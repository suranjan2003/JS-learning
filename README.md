learning js from chai aur javascript playlist


## some notes

default JS behaviours
1) synchronous --> ek code execute hoga > next code > next code > ...
2) single threaded --> takes so much time

execution context
 --> executed one line of a code at a time
  --> each operation waits for the previous one to complete before execution

blocking code (synconous)
  --> blocks the flow of program
  --> Read file Sync

non-blocking code (asynconous)
 --> Does not blocks the flow of program
  --> Read file Async
